                       site requested  >>   www.hostinger.com

DNS Resolver:  It is the primary intermediary between computer and the other DNS servers.
               When it receives the request, first it will check in cache to find matching IP address for domain name.
               If found, the site will be displayed and if not then the request will be sent to root nameserver.


ROOT Nameserver:  It is at the top of DNS hierarchy.
                  It doesn't have IP address and domain info but it gives direction to where it can be found.
                  So when request comes from DNS resolver, the ROOT nameserver will immediately identify the top-level domain (TLD) of the domain name.
                   (e.g., .com for www.hostinger.com)
                  And will tell the recursive resolver to go to the coreect TLD Nameserver.


TLD Nameserver:   Here the ROOT nameserver will redirect the resolver to .com TLD nameserver.
                  Then TLD Nameserver will inform the location of IP address at a specific authoritative nameserver .ie. hostinger


Authoritative Nameserver:  It is final step in DNS resolution process.
                           It stores all the information related to the domain name you want to visit, inclusimg IP address.
                           So resolver will obtain the IP and send it back to your computer, directing you to the site.
                           Finally, the DNS resolver performs DNS caching, storing  IP address collected from authoritative nameserver as temporary data.
