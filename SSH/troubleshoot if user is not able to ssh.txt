# Check for Incorrect Username or Password

# Check the PasswordAuthentication setting in (/etc/ssh/sshd_config). If it's set to no, password authentication is disabled.

# Misconfigurations in the SSH server settings may lead to authentication failures.  Mainly check for settings like> AllowUsers, DenyUsers, and PermitRootLogin.

# Too many failed login attempts can lock account temporarily. Check the system logs or use the faillock command to determine if the account is locked.

# Incorrect permissions on the user's home directory, ~/.ssh directory, or authorized_keys file 

#If the user account has an expired password, PuTTY may prompt for the password but reject it.  
Check the password expiration status using the chage command: chage -l username

# Problems with the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) configuration can cause authentication failures. Check the /etc/pam.d/sshd file for any misconfigurations.

# If Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is enabled and misconfigured, it may prevent login. Check SELinux logs or temporarily disable SELinux to test.

# If firewall rules blocking SSH traffic, PuTTY may not be able to establish a connection. Confirm that the firewall allows incoming connections on the SSH port 22.

# If you have set up key-based authentication and the private key doesn't match the public key on the server, PuTTY may fall back to password authentication. 
Ensure that your private key matches the public key on the server.

# If the server is under heavy load or experiencing resource limitations, it may affect the ability to authenticate users.
