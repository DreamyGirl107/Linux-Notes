# vim /root/.my.cnf                                         |  .my.cnf in your home directory is only read by the mysql clients, so this is not where you should set system variables for the mysql server. 
user=root                                                   |  .my.cnf can be used e.g. for your credentials so that you can log in without having to type the username and password every time.
