 chage - change user password expiry information

User account locked with the -l option can still log in by other methods such as the ssh public key authentication. 

Use the following command to for full account locking:
chage -E 0 {username}                          ( full lockdown for user named sapna )
#chage -E 0 sapna

#chage -E -1 sapna                              (Passing the number -1 as the EXPIRE_DATE will remove an account expiration date)
